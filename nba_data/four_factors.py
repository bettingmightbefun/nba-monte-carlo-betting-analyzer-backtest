===============

NBA Four Factors statistics fetching and analysis.
The Four Factors are the key basketball metrics that research shows 
are most predictive of wins and losses.

Functions
---------
get_four_factors_team_stats(team_name: str, season_end_year: int, last_n_games: int = None) -> Dict[str, float]
    Get Four Factors team statistics from NBA API.

The Four Factors are:
- EFG% (Effective Field Goal %): Shooting efficiency accounting for 3-point value
- FTA Rate: Free throw attempt rate (aggression getting to the line)  
- TOV% (Turnover %): Ball security and possession management
- OREB% (Offensive Rebounding %): Second-chance opportunities

This module focuses on these advanced basketball analytics that provide
better predictive power than traditional team ratings alone.
