========================

This module handles league-wide NBA analytics and API connectivity testing.
Provides functions to calculate league averages and verify NBA API access.

Functions
---------
compute_league_average_ortg(season_end_year: int) -> float
    Compute league-wide average offensive rating for a season.

test_api_connection() -> bool
    Test if NBA API is working and accessible.

This module focuses on league-wide calculations and system diagnostics,
separate from individual team statistics.
