## 🎯 What This Does

Transform raw NBA statistics into actionable betting insights through advanced simulation and proven basketball analytics:

### 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation Engine**
- Runs **100,000 virtual games** by default with realistic variance
- One-click **High Precision (1M simulations)** mode for tighter confidence intervals
- Models shooting hot/cold streaks, pace variations, defensive breakdowns
- Captures natural basketball randomness that deterministic models miss
- Shows results like: "Home team covers in 62,847 out of 100,000 games" or "314,201 out of 1,000,000" when high precision is enabled

### 🏀 **Four Factors Analysis (NEW)**
Our enhanced model now incorporates the **Four Factors** - the key basketball metrics that research shows are most predictive of wins:

- **EFG% (Effective Field Goal %)**: Shooting efficiency accounting for 3-point value
- **FTA Rate**: Free throw attempt rate (aggression getting to the line)
- **TOV% (Turnover %)**: Ball security and possession management
- **OREB% (Offensive Rebounding %)**: Second-chance opportunities

These factors are weighted based on extensive basketball research and provide significantly better predictive power than traditional team ratings alone.

Our simulator now turns those Four Factor edges (plus high-leverage misc stats like points off turnovers and second chance production) into dynamic offensive efficiency multipliers. Teams that get cleaner looks, protect the ball, or dominate the glass will see higher expected points per possession, while turnover-prone or physical defenses can suppress opponents in the simulations.

### 🔍 **Smart Data Analysis**
- Fetches real-time NBA team statistics from official NBA.com API
- Analyzes both full season and recent form (last 10 games) performance
- Applies recency weighting to capture current team momentum
- Injects **schedule fatigue, venue splits, hustle effort signals, and head-to-head trends** sourced directly from NBA endpoints
- Surfaces **head-to-head matchup context** with win/loss splits, scoring margins, and recent game logs
- **Fails fast with clear errors** – no neutral placeholders or synthetic backups when data is missing

### 📊 **Advanced Statistical Modeling**
- Realistic variance in team performance (±4 pace, ±6 ORtg, ±5 DRtg)
- Four Factors variance modeling (±0.04 EFG%, ±0.03 TOV%, etc.)
- Confidence interval for the mean margin and full margin distributions
- True probability distributions from actual simulated outcomes
- Industry-standard approach used by professional betting models

### 🏟️ **Real-World Context Layers (NEW)**
- **Schedule Fatigue**: Rest-day tracking, back-to-back detection, and fatigue score modifiers baked into the model
- **Venue Splits**: Home/road performance deltas tune offensive and defensive ratings for the game environment
- **Hustle Effort**: League-ranked deflections, charges, and loose balls shift turnover/extra-chance projections
- **Head-to-Head Matchups**: Multi-season history, recent meetings, and historical margin nudges feed matchup-specific edges
- Every contextual layer is pulled live from NBA.com and surfaced in the UI and raw data exports

### 🤝 **Head-to-Head Matchup Intelligence (NEW)**
- Aggregates **multi-season regular-season meetings** between the two clubs using the official LeagueGameFinder endpoint
- Calculates **win/loss records, average scoring margins, recent results, and streaks** for each side
- Applies **light offensive efficiency nudges** when one team has consistently dominated the matchup
- Clearly surfaces head-to-head context within both the structured JSON payload and text-based model report

### 💰 **Betting Intelligence**
- Clear BET/NO BET recommendations based on simulation results
- Expected value calculations from real game outcomes
- Detailed breakdowns of every simulated game (100k standard / 1M high precision)
- Professional-grade insights with transparent methodology

## 🧠 The Monte Carlo Model Explained

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Official NBA.com API via `nba_api` package
- **Real-time**: No cached or outdated statistics
- **Comprehensive**: Advanced metrics including pace, ORtg, DRtg
- **Zero fallbacks**: System fails fast if real data unavailable

### Monte Carlo Simulation Process

1. **Data Collection & Weighting**
   ```
   Season Stats + Last 10 Games → Weighted Average
   Final Stat = (Season × (1 - Weight)) + (Recent × Weight)
   ```

2. **Variance Modeling** (Based on NBA Research)
   ```
   Game Pace = Team Average ± 4.0 possessions
   Offensive Rating = Team Average ± 6.0 points per 100 possessions
   Defensive Rating = Team Average ± 5.0 points per 100 possessions
   ```

3. **Single Game Simulation**
   ```
   For each simulated game (100k standard / 1M high precision):
   - Generate random pace variation
   - Apply shooting variance (hot/cold nights)
   - Calculate possession-adjusted scores
   - Add game-specific randomness (±8 points)
   - Record final score and spread result
   ```

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   ```
   Cover Probability = Games Home Covers / Simulations
   Expected Value = True Probability × Payout - (1 - Probability) × Stake
   Confidence Interval = Mean ± 1.96 × (Standard Deviation / √Simulations)
   ```

### Why Monte Carlo > Deterministic Models

**Traditional Model**: "Lakers expected to win by 2.1 points"
**Monte Carlo**: "Lakers cover -3.5 in 62,847 out of 100,000 games" (or "314,201 out of 1,000,000" in high precision)

The simulation captures real basketball variance that theoretical models miss!

### Key Formulas

**Possessions**: `FGA + 0.44 × FTA - ORB + TOV`

**Offensive Rating**: `100 × Points / Possessions`

**Defensive Rating**: `100 × Opponent Points / Possessions`

**Pace**: `48 × Possessions / (Minutes / 5)`
